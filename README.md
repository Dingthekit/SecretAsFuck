# HMS-Express-v2

First.. I'm really sorry that I have to rebuild all the project again.
Here are the steps to setup the New Project.

1. Back up your previous work done which has not been pushed to previous project
2. Turn off all Xcode and reopen again.
3. Clone the .git which name is HMS-Express-v2 
4. Open Terminal and cd to the path of the folder
5. $pod install
6. Then click on the project file which is the white color instead of blue.
7. Should be working
